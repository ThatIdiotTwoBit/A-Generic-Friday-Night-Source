# A-Generic-Friday-Night-Source
"That really pisses on me." - someone in our dev team

**Part 0: Welcome!**

Just a modified Psych Engine. That's all. This modified Psych Engine is for the mod, **A Generic Friday Night!** The link is here, as well as somewhere in part 1. If this source code has anything wrong (say that it wouldn't compile, it happens.), let me know so I can get that shit fixed. I have files everywhere so I may have misplaced some shit. I read GitHub shit very now and then so I will find it in within a week. Please be paitient. ;-; In addition, if a problem is "game-breaking" or "TwoBit, you fucking screwed up,", please don't issue and issue, but instead, reach out to me directly through my Discord DMs (TwoBit#0002) or my Twitter DMs (@ThatIdiotTwoBit). I suggest going to my Discord DMs because I read those a lot often than on Twitter, but both ways are good ways of reaching out to me. If Psych Engine is outdated, also do let me know so I can port the mod into Psych Engine's newer version. (Ports psych engine to psych engine lmao)

**Part 1: Game**

This page is the source code, so you can take code and use it for your own mod. 
If you are looking for the mod (for players), here is the link. 
In order to launch the game through source code, you must have the compiling prequisites first. If you don't have them, follow the following steps. Otherwise, skip to Part 2.

**NOTE:** When I refer to terminal, I mean COommand Prompt, Windows PowerShell, Terminal in Visual Studio Code, etc.

In order to launch the game, you must install the following.
- Haxe (Latest Version): https://haxe.org/download/file/4.2.5/haxe-4.2.5-win64.exe/
  - Seriously, stop using Haxe 4.1.5. It fucks things up.
- HaxeFlixel (Run these commands in a terminal with 'haxelib install' at the beginning of it): https://haxeflixel.com/documentation/install-haxeflixel/
  - In addition, you must install these extra thingies.
     - flixel
     - flixel-addons
     - flixel-ui
     - hscript
     - newgrounds
- Git: https://git-scm.com/
  - You will then need to install things with Git (that you just downloaded lol) in a terminal.
     - haxelib git polymod https://github.com/larsiusprime/polymod.git (dunno what this does)
     - haxelib git discord_rpc https://github.com/Aidan63/linc_discord-rpc (Discord Rich Presense) 
     - haxelib git flixel-addons https://github.com/HaxeFlixel/flixel-addon (dunno what this does)
- Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code
  - Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code are NOT the same thing. 
     - https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=win (Visual Studio Code) - Get the **LATEST** version.
     - https://my.visualstudio.com/Downloads?q=visual%20studio%202019&wt.mc_id=o~msft~vscom~older-downloads (Visual Studio) Get the **2019** version.
       - For Visual Studio, select the 2019 Community version and only the community version (I never tried the other versions lmao).
   
Now that you have everything installed, go to **VISUAL STUDIO** and we're going to ignore ninjamuffin99's instructions for a bit. Instead of manually selecting two items and watching it still not work, select the **Desktop Development with C++** workload. It'll take some storage (about 6.5 GB I think), but I assure you it'll remove most if not all your errors.

After that, head over to Visual Studio Code and install Lime. Lime will be the thing you use to compile the thing.
  - https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=openfl.lime-vscode-extension

After doing that, go to your source code folder, select the folder address line path thingy and type 'cmd'. It should load up Command Prompt. If you prefer Powershell or some other terminal, copy the source code folder address line path thingy and type, 'cd' and following it with the source code line path thingy. Then you should be able to run 'lime test windows', wait for shit to happen, then ye.

**Part 2: License and Permissions**

In the source code, there is a folder called "public-work" and this folder contains the FLPs, MIDIs, FLAs, etc. available for you to use. There's nothing more to say.
If you want to collab, cameo your mod in ours, or any shits like that, DM TwoBit#0002 on Discord or send a DM on my Twitter (@ThatIdiotTwoBit). If you are using our work in the most despicable way possible, please stop. lmao.
In addition, if you want to make spin-offs of our mod, go ahead and do so. Nobody is stopping you. Just credit though, otherwise I will be very mad and I will cancel you. (Spin-offs include: B-Sides, Corruption, AUs, Character Additions, but bad, etc.) If you make a spin-off we don't like (Mostly goes with NSFW spin-offs), we will ask you to take it down once, otherwise we will report u. >:C No mercy for bitches.
I also ask you not to redistribute the mod as your own to other gaming sites. Sharing links to the GameBanana or GameJolt page is alright with us. 
If we catch you doing this shit, we will be very mad at you. >:C

**Part 3: Other Information**

Other Information:
- A lot of us are minors, do not draw lewd or rule 34 art of our characters.
- If your mod characters are in the mod and you **DO NOT** want them there, DM me on Discord or Twitter and I'll remove them right when I see it (and apply it to the next update)
- If you want to work on the mod, DM me on Discord ONLY and be ready to show some work.

That's it. Uh. Stay Funky!
