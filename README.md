# A-Generic-Friday-Night-Source
Just a modified Psych Engine. That's all.

**Part 1: Game**

This page is the source code, so you can take code and use it for your own mod. 
If you are looking for the mod (for players), here is the link. 
In order to launch the game through source code, you must have the compiling prequisites first. If you don't have them, follow the following steps. Otherwise, skip to Part 2.

In order to launch the game, you must install the following.
- Haxe (Latest Version): https://haxe.org/download/file/4.2.5/haxe-4.2.5-win64.exe/
- HaxeFlixel (Run these commands in a terminal with 'haxelib install' at the beginning of it): https://haxeflixel.com/documentation/install-haxeflixel/
  - In addition, you must install these extra thingies.
     - flixel
     - flixel-addons
     - flixel-ui
     - hscript
     - newgrounds
- Git: https://git-scm.com/
  - You will then need to install things with Git (that you just downloaded lol) in a terminal.
     - haxelib git polymod https://github.com/larsiusprime/polymod.git (dunno what this does)
     - haxelib git discord_rpc https://github.com/Aidan63/linc_discord-rpc (Discord Rich Presense) 
     - haxelib git flixel-addons https://github.com/HaxeFlixel/flixel-addon (dunno what this does)
- Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code
  - Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code are NOT the same thing. 
     - https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=win (Visual Studio Code)
     - https://my.visualstudio.com/Downloads?q=visual%20studio%202019&wt.mc_id=o~msft~vscom~older-downloads (Visual Studio)
       - For Visual Studio, select the Community version and only the community version.
   
Now that you have everything installed, go to **VISUAL STUDIO** and we're going to ignore ninjamuffin99's instructions for a bit. Instead of manually selecting two items and watching it still not work, select the **Desktop Development C++** workload. It'll take some storage, but I assure you it'll remove most if not all your errors.

After that, head over to Visual Studio Code and install Lime. Lime will be the thing you use to compile the thing.
  - https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=openfl.lime-vscode-extension

After doing that, go to your source code folder, select the folder address line path thingy and type 'cmd'. It should load up Command Prompt. If you prefer Powershell or some other terminal, copy the source code folder adress line path thingy and type, 'cd' and following it with the source code line path thingy. Then you should be able to run 'lime test windows', wait for shit to happen, then ye.

**Part 2: License and Permissions**

In the source code, there is a folder called "public-work" and this folder contains the FLPs, MIDIs, FLAs, etc. available for you to use. There's nothing more to say.
If you want to collab, cameo your mod in ours, or any shits like that, DM TwoBit#0002 on Discord or send a DM on my Twitter (@ThatIdiotTwoBit). If you are using our work in the most despicable way possible, please stop. lmao.

**Part 3: Other Information**

All the characters in the mod are real people, and we ask of you to not lewd these characters. Although just saying it here won't do anything, we do not want to see lewd art of our own characters. A lot of us are minors.

That's it. Uh. Stay Funky!
